## 1. Framework Overview

### What are Event Loop Frameworks?

Event loop frameworks provide the foundation for **asynchronous, event-driven applications**:
- Handle UI events, network I/O, timers
- Manage concurrency and threading
- Provide programming abstractions

### Framework Comparison

**SW Task Framework**: Modern C++ multi-thread architecture with advanced resource management  
**Tiger Looper Framework**: Traditional single-thread Android-style pattern with POSIX timers

**Target Applications**: Automotive telematics and embedded systems

## 2.1 Performance Analysis

### SW Task: Multi-Thread Architecture for Different Workloads

**Main Thread (UI/IO - Non-blocking)**:
- Processes non-blocking I/O operations and UI events
- Uses unified EventQueue with pollNext() for event processing
- All callbacks executed on main thread ensuring UI responsiveness
- Never blocks on heavy computations

**CPU Worker Thread**:
- Dedicated thread for heavy processing operations (file operations, JSON parsing, crypto)
- Completely isolated from UI thread using CpuTaskExecutor
- Communicates results back via Promise/State mechanism
- Prevents UI blocking during intensive computations

### SW Task: Promise-based Concurrency

- A mechanism to store callback in Promise<T> object as continuation function
- When Promise value is fulfilled, continuation is executed asynchronously on main thread event loop
- Support Promise chain: sequence of multiple callbacks triggered in sequential order with exception handling

### Tiger: Sequential Processing Limitations

**Single Event Thread**:
- All operations processed sequentially
- UI blocks on CPU tasks (50-200ms)
- No parallelism possible

**Issues**: UI blocking, no isolation, poor scalability

## 2.2 Efficiency Analysis

### SW Task: Advanced Timer Management

**Single Dedicated Timer Thread Architecture**:

**Core Design**:
- 1 dedicated timer thread handles 1000+ timers efficiently
- Linux epoll + timerfd kernel integration for optimal performance
- O(1) timer creation, deletion, and expiration operations
- Constant memory usage regardless of timer count

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Scalability**: Single thread scales to thousands of timers
- **Kernel Optimization**: Direct Linux timerfd integration eliminates polling
- **Memory Efficiency**: Fixed memory footprint vs. thread-per-timer approach
- **Performance**: O(1) operations ensure consistent response times

**Operational Efficiency**:
- Timer events processed via epoll_wait() with minimal CPU overhead
- Expired timer callbacks posted to main thread for execution
- Automatic cleanup of one-shot timers, persistent handling of periodic timers
- Thread-safe cancellation without blocking timer operations

**Benefits**: Thread efficiency, memory conservation, kernel optimization


### Tiger: Thread Proliferation Problem

**SIGEV_THREAD Resource Waste**:
- Each timer creates new thread
- 100 timers = 100 threads = 800MB memory
- Context switch overhead
- Poor scalability (limited to ~100 timers)

**Issues**: Thread explosion, memory waste, system overhead

## 2.3 Usability Analysis

### SW Task: Facade Pattern

**Unified Interface (SLLooper)**:
- Single entry point for all functionality
- Hides complex subsystem interactions
- Multiple access methods for different skill levels

**Message API (Android Developers)**:
- Familiar Handler/Message pattern
- Zero learning curve for Android developers
- Complete backward compatibility

**Function API (Modern C++)**:
- Leverages lambdas, auto, RAII
- Type-safe operations
- Clean, concise syntax

**Promise API (Async Experts)**:
- Advanced async composition
- Built-in exception propagation
- Declarative programming model

**Benefits**: Complexity hiding, developer choice, type safety

### Tiger: Monolithic Interface

**Single Access Pattern**:
- Only Message/Handler programming style
- No facade abstraction
- Type unsafe void* operations
- Verbose code required

**Issues**: Complexity exposed, limited choice, unsafe operations

## 2.4 Reusability Analysis

### SW Task: Backward Compatible Enhancement

**Legacy API Preservation**:
- All Tiger APIs preserved unchanged
- Existing code compiles without modifications
- Binary compatibility maintained

**Modern API Addition**:
- Function and Promise APIs added to same classes
- Template-based type safety
- RAII resource management

**Unified Processing**:
- Message and Function use same queue
- Legacy and modern code coexist
- Zero risk migration

**Benefits**: API preservation, gradual evolution, investment protection

### Tiger: No Evolution Support

**Static API Design**:
- Cannot add new features safely
- Breaking changes required for improvements
- High regression risk

**Issues**: Static design, migration required, investment loss
